## Try Java Statements in JShell

`JShell`, a command-line program included in the __Java Development Kit (JDK)__, can be used to type in a single Java statement and see what it does.

This is similar the way that Python command line environment is doing.

JShell is a _language shell_, an interactive environment that makes it possible to play with Java by entering commands. Each command is a Java statement. Once you hit `Enter`, the statement is executed by the JVM as if it was part of a complete Java program.

To run JShell, in Linux, you can just execute `jshell` in terminal. The file is located in the subfolder called `bin` in the folder installed JDK.

```
$ jshell
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.9
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> /exit
   Goodbye
$
```
